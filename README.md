## 🌟 Project Impact & Key Features

This project demonstrates how AI can empower emergency response teams like Indonesia's **BNPB** to:
- **Filter Critical Signals:** Instantly separate urgent pleas from social media noise.
- **Reduce Triage Time:** Cut down analysis time from hours to minutes.
- **Prioritize Life-Saving Actions:** Intelligently categorize reports for efficient resource allocation.
- **Generate Actionable Intelligence:** Summarize complex situations into concise executive briefings.

## ⚙️ Technical Workflow

This project uses a dual-phase AI process for maximum impact:

    A[Raw Tweet Data] --> B(Step 1: Classification Engine);
    B --> C{Urgent Plea for Help?};
    C -- Yes --> D(Step 2: Summarization Engine);

    B --> F[Infrastructure Reports];
    B --> G[Informational];
    D --> H[🚨 Actionable Executive Briefing];

> 🚨 **CRITICAL SITUATION BRIEFING** 🚨
>
> * **Recurring Theme: Flooding & Trapped Individuals:** Multiple reports indicate families trapped by rising floodwaters, particularly in multi-story buildings.
> * **Key Infrastructure Damage:** Reports of a collapsed bridge on a major highway are hindering evacuation efforts.
> * **Medical Emergencies:** Several urgent requests for medical assistance, including for elderly individuals and those with injuries.

## 🚀 How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thyco5/AI-Disaster-Response-Classifier.git
    cd AI-Disaster-Response-Classifier
    ```
2.  **Set Up Environment:** Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configure API Key:** Open `Disaster_Tweet_Analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab. Add your Replicate API key to Colab Secrets with the name `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`.
4.  **Execute:** Run all notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis and generate outputs.
